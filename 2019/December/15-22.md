# 15th December to 22nd December

### Lots o' new stuffs
As everyone knows we got our dedicated server, we've been keeping a close eye on the performance and are happy to say that it is MUCH better. Even with multiple people rtping and flying around we kept 20tps.
So, now that is done, we are now making new stuff again + changing things due to the new capabilities

## Changed
* Server render distance is now 12 (was 6)
* Jobs are much harder (_thanks for reporting that guys...._)
* Chat is now running under Essentials rather than DeluxeChat
* We have autobroadcasts announcing the sale
* Rule enforcement
* and probably quite a few other things I have forgotten

## Added
* We added new commands! /block and /cook - You can look at a chest (or hopper or whatever!) and change all items to blocks! This is available to donators
* HotBarPets has been added, get your Walshrus pet now!
* SoulShards, you can now make really awesome spawners
* StackMob, this replaces UltimateStacker. Much better for the server and for you guys
* Ability for Mercenary to punch staff into the sky
* EmojiChat - Send your hearts as proper :heart: emojis now

## Removed
* DeluxeChat
* DeluxeJoin - replaced by essentials and new plugin
* UltimateStacker
* Custom Crafting
* Relics
* LWC - Claim your chests part of your town or get raided!
